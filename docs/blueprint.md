# **App Name**: Sādhanā Suite

## Core Features:

- Sādhanā Selection: Allow users to select Sādhanās (daily practices) such as 'Japa', 'Scripture Reading', 'Meditation', and 'Chanting', from a predefined list.
- Practice Tracking: Provide a simple tracking mechanism (checkbox for completion, field for minutes meditated) for each selected Sādhanā.
- Streak Visualization: Display a 'streak' counter to motivate consistent practice.
- Quote of the Day: The LLM selects a daily quote from a 'Wisdom Snippets' tool and displays it, attributed to one of the four Peethams.
- Followed Events Display: Automatically display upcoming events from the main calendar that the user has marked as 'interested' or 'attending'.
- Event Links: Provide direct links to the event detail pages in the 'Followed Events' widget.
- Learning Suggestions: Track user viewing history and then the LLM provides 2-3 new, related content suggestions. For example, suggest a related article or discourse.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) to evoke wisdom, spirituality, and the richness of tradition. Gold complements the dashboard's theme of enlightenment and practice.
- Background color: Desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), close in hue to gold, for a calm, peaceful backdrop that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Light brown (#B8860B), an analogous color, is chosen for interactive elements and highlights. This color evokes feelings of connection to earth.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, line-based icons for Sādhanās and navigation, to convey focus and simplicity.
- Employ a modular, widget-based layout allowing users to customize their dashboard. Widgets should be draggable and resizable.
- Subtle animations for streak updates and content loading, to provide positive feedback and a sense of progress.
