# Architecture Review & Deployment Readiness

This document provides a review of the current technical architecture of the Sanatana Peethams Portal and assesses its readiness for deployment, especially concerning the newly proposed features.

## 1. Current Architecture: Static Portal

The website is currently built as a **Static Portal**. This means all the content is pre-built and delivered to users as-is.

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with React.
    *   **Assessment:** Excellent choice. This provides a fast, modern user experience and is highly scalable. The code organization into pages, components (`/ui`, `/layout`), and libraries (`/lib`) is strong and follows best practices.
*   **Data Source:** Local TypeScript Files (e.g., `/lib/peethams-data.ts`, `/lib/sringeri-media.ts`).
    *   **Assessment:** This is a simple and effective method for managing content on a static site. It keeps the data well-organized and easy to update by a developer.
*   **Database:** **None.**
    *   **Assessment:** There is currently no database connected to the project. This is the primary limitation for our new features.

### Current State Conclusion

The current structure is **strong and well-organized** for its purpose as a static information portal. It is lightweight, fast, and ready for a simple deployment on any modern hosting platform (like Vercel, Netlify, or Google Cloud).

However, it is **not wide enough** to support the dynamic and personalized features you have requested (user notes, watched video status, quizzes, etc.), because it has no way to store information that is unique to each user.

## 2. Proposed Architecture: Dynamic Web Application

To implement the new features, we must evolve the architecture into a **Dynamic Web Application**. This is the plan outlined in the `new-features-proposal.md`.

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with React.
    *   **Assessment:** No change needed. The foundation is already strong.
*   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Firebase.
    *   **Authentication:** We will use **Firebase Authentication** to manage user sign-up and login. This is a secure, reliable, and industry-standard solution.
    *   **Database:** We will use **Firebase Firestore** as our database. This is a powerful, scalable NoSQL database that will store all user-specific data like notes, quiz scores, and watched videos.

### Proposed State Conclusion

By integrating Firebase, we will create a **strong and wide** architecture that is ready for deployment.

*   It will be **strong** because it separates the frontend (Next.js) from the backend (Firebase) and uses a secure, managed service for user data.
*   It will be **wide** because it gives us the capability to add almost any user-specific feature we can imagine in the future. The database can easily be expanded to store new types of information.

## Final Recommendation

I approve of the current code structure and confirm that the next logical step is to implement the proposed architecture using **Firebase**. This will prepare the website for a scalable and feature-rich deployment.

Once you approve the proposal, I will begin this implementation.
